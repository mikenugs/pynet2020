* Libraries

To check which version of python your system runs

/usr/bin/python

To import a library in this example regex library.A module is a single python file and a package is a directory of related python files that are related to each other. 

import re

To see where Python found the library
re.__file__



Python will first go out and find the file and will process it line by line from top to bottom and loads in what is in their. This can include imports from other programs. 

When you import in this way all your names will be re.somthing
help(re.search)

Another way to import in python is to import like below. 
from re import search, findall

Python will load the re library from top to bottom. Now instead of having to do re.search you can just do search so your name space changes slightly.
help(search)

Python uses sys.path to search location information for its packages. To see the path you can
import sys
sys.path

The mull string path is the current directory and all the other directories are self explanitory. .egg files are similar to tar files and they are python libraries. 

To modify your sys.path in Linux
In your ~/.bashrc file
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH=:/usr/local/django/pynet
OR
export PYTHONPATH=:/usr/local/django/pynet
To confirm 
env | grep PYTHONPATH

* PIP

PIP is the general way to install packages in Python. It will download not just the package but its dependencies as well. Pckages can be found from
https://pypi.org/

To install a package
pip install netmiko
To confirm it is installed
import netmiko
OR
netmiko.__file__

To see what version is installed

netmiko.__version__

To install a specific version of a package

pip install netmiko==2.0.1

You can upgrade a package by "this will upgrade the dependencies as well"

pip install --upgrade netmiko

To see all of the installed packages

pip list

To uninstall a pip package

pip uninstall netmiko

You can also use git to install a package from github

pip install git+https://github.com/ktbyersBLAH/netmiko.git@develop

To ensure that you install the correct package with the version of python that you use you can envoke pip this way

python -m pip install netmiko

* Python virtual environments

Used to have a sandbox to install packages on. This will be a sandbox with a fresh install of python. It will have almost no pip packages installed so you can install whatever is needed. This way you do not mess up the system python when installing packages. 

To create a virtualenvironment

virtualenv3.6 -p /usr/bin/python36 test_venv

To access it

source test_env/bin/activate

To exit it

deactivate

To see which sandboxes are available look at the directory where you have created the virtual environments and do a 
ls

* Creating a python module

!devices.py
rtr1 = {
	'ip': '1.1.1.1',
	'hostname': 'admin',
	'password': 'pass123',
}
!devices.py

Make sure your python file that you create is in your sys.path

To import the module

import devices

To look at the options
dir(devices)

To access the dictionary we created

devices.rtr1

If the module is not in sys.path you can add it

export PYTHONPATH=/home/gituser/SB/lesson8

You can also import just the dictionary we created

from devices import rtr1

rtr1  <-- to see the dictionary
